			<h1>Portfolio</h1>
			<p>
                Welcome to my portfolio. In this page is the information
                about what i've done around programming.
			</p>
			<p>
                Project link opens my github-repository, where you can look at my school work 
                with different kind of programming languages and frameworks/libraries. 
                From Demolab link (it's in Finnish, so short explanation (thought there is also code examples)) 
                you can look at my Tircorporate Demolab 2020 spring work (small portfolio) which 
                included programming data collecting node.js/express backend and frontend that handled 
                displaying data analytics using Angular for the game called Virtual Shock (virtual reality horror game). 
                Data was collected from unity using controller that sended data in JSON to backend which sended data into AWS SQL-database.
				Frontend also had CMS features.
			</p>
			<p>
                Experience I've mostly from JavaScript and TypeScript programming. Included frameworks/libraries 
                are Angular, React, Node.js and Express. Angular and Node/Express are familiar for me 
                from Web-application development course and Demolab. React I've studied in Fullstackopen-course by 
                University of Helsinki (7cr). I've also completed C#-basics programming course and C++-course. 
                Currently I'm working on Jakarta EE-course. I've used Unity (C#) in game development-course, where 
                I did 2D-metroidvania style of game as my final project.

				Databases I've used are MongoDB and MySQL.
